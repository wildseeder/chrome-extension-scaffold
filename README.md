# Chrome Extension Scaffold

This is a sample project that demonstrates how, in the development process of a Chrome extension, you can achieve a complete modern development experience with major popular front-end frameworks without the need to eject, including features like HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Thanks to symbolic links, achieving all of this requires only minimal configuration.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn dep

# develop
yarn dev

# build
yarn build
```
